## Disclaimers

This project was completed under a tight time constraint, and while I focused on hitting all core objectives with clean structure and polish, there are still several things I would love to expand on given more time.
These include refining the animation timing, improving the modularity even further, and organizing certain assets more clearly.

Despite that, I aimed to present a strong foundation that reflects how I think as a UI Technical Artist, prioritizing modularity and creative presentation.
